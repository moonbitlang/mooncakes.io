      "docstring": " Create a new UDP socket.\n\n Similar to `socket(AF_INET or AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP)` in POSIX.\n On IPv6 sockets, IPV6_V6ONLY is enabled by default and can't be configured otherwise.\n\n This function does not require a network capability handle. This is considered to be safe because\n at time of creation, the socket is not bound to any `network` yet. Up to the moment `bind` is called,\n the socket is effectively an in-memory configuration object, unable to communicate with the outside world.\n\n All sockets are non-blocking. Use the wasi-poll interface to block on asynchronous operations.\n\n # Typical errors\n - `not-supported`:     The specified `address-family` is not supported. (EAFNOSUPPORT)\n - `new-socket-limit`:  The new socket resource could not be created because of a system limit.
