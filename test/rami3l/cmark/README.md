# cmark

Cmark is a [CommonMark][CommonMark specification] toolkit for the MoonBit programming language,
started as a MoonBit rewrite of the [`cmarkit`] library from the OCaml ecosystem.

So far, it supports the following use cases:

- Parsing CommonMark documents with best-effort source-aware layout preservation:
- Rendering CommonMark documents via the `Renderer` API, along with a ready-to-use HTML renderer.

Supported CommonMark features include:

- Vanilla CommonMark syntax;
- Common syntax extensions, including:
  - Strikethroughs
  - Task lists
  - Footnotes
  - Tables
  - Inline math
  - Math blocks

## Building

To begin, you will need to install a recent MoonBit toolchain.
To do so, please refer to instructions at MoonBit's
[official website](https://www.moonbitlang.com/download).

Once you have the toolchain installed, you can build this project by running the following command:

```sh
moon build
```

## Testing

With the MoonBit toolchain installed, you can run the tests by executing the following command:

```sh
moon test
```
