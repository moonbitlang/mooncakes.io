This is an experimental package to manipulate open source fonts with [MoonBit].

All fonts are open source and their licenses can all be found in their corresponding
repos which are organized by the first letter of the name of the font:

* font: https://github.com/gmlewis/mbt-fonts-a/tree/master/aaarghnormal
* license: https://github.com/gmlewis/go-fonts-a/tree/master/fonts/aaarghnormal
* ...
* font: https://github.com/gmlewis/mbt-fonts-b/tree/master/baloo
* license: https://github.com/gmlewis/go-fonts-b/tree/master/fonts/baloo
* ...
* font: https://github.com/gmlewis/mbt-fonts-z/tree/master/znikomitno24
* license: https://github.com/gmlewis/go-fonts-z/tree/master/fonts/znikomitno24

## Status

The code has been updated to support compiler:

```bash
$ moon version --all
moon 0.1.20241216 (b57ed1c 2024-12-16) ~/.moon/bin/moon
moonc v0.1.20241216+68e710374 ~/.moon/bin/moonc
moonrun 0.1.20241216 (b57ed1c 2024-12-16) ~/.moon/bin/moonrun
```

Use `moonup` to manage `moon` compiler versions:
