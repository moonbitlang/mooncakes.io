The response is sent by calling the `response-outparam.set`\n method, which allows execution to continue after the response has been\n sent. This enables both streaming to the response body, and performing other\n work.\n\n The implementor of this function must write a response to the\n `response-outparam` before returning, or else the caller will respond\n with an error on its behalf.",
